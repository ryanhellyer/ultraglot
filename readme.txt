Problems:
At what point is the group ID created.
If we create the group ID when the first post is published.



** List of posts in meta box **
If current post already has a group ID, then need to check if post already has a group ID - don't display if it already has one (which doesn't match the current posts group ID)
If the current post doesn't have a group ID, then need to grab group ID from the other post.
If neither post have group ID's, then need to set group ID for both of them.
